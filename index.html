		The Pokémon franchise has been around for as long as most of us can remember, some before we were even born and others after or around the same time we came into the world. For me, personally, my first experience was in the year 1999 (I was born in 1995), so around when I was four years old. The first Pokémon game I got my hands on was<u>Pokémon Yellow Version</u> for the Game Boy. Yellow wasn’t all that different from<u>Pokémon Red and Blue</u>, the first games of the franchise to release in North America. The key difference in Yellow, however, was that the player started off with Pikachu and was able to receive all three of the starter Pokémon, Charmander, Bulbasaur, and Squirtle, on their journey. At the time this was a pretty big deal and very exciting to players, as you could not receive all the starters from Pokémon Red and Blue, unless you traded them with your friends.
		<pre></pre>Pokémon continued to advance through the years after its initial release of the first games. It’s safe to say that the franchise caught fire and sky rocketed as a new gaming craze throughout the world. Nintendo then released their second set of Pokémon games in North America during the year 2000, titled<u>Pokémon Gold and Silver</u>. These versions introduced a whole new set of Pokémon to battle and catch, as well as the original 151 in the previous games. I’m sure everyone that has been a fan of the series and still are know the rest and how the games advanced through the years. Below is a link to a table of the games released from the first installment in the franchise to the most recent installment.
